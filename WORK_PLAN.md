## Operator Attention: Merge-Risk-Hold Pileup

Judge-approved PRs under a hold (`loom:blocked` or `loom:operator`) — only a human merge decision is missing.

_None._

## Very Important

`loom:very-important` (one counts per workspace); every stage takes these first.

_None._

## Important

`loom:important`; taken before unlabelled work.

- **#174**: Whole-block characterization: post-layout PVT, dynamic power and IR evidence
- **#307**: Whole-block 12-point PVT matrix: run on the klt batch fleet once the runner image matches the client (follow-up of #174)

## Ready

Human-approved issues ready for implementation (`loom:issue`).

- **#307**: Whole-block 12-point PVT matrix: run on the klt batch fleet once the runner image matches the client (follow-up of #174)
- **#314**: Re-pin open_pdks to f6eeac7 (ciel) — fleet retires volare c6d73a3

## In Progress

Issues currently being built (`loom:building`).

- **#221**: Decision record request: local mismatch can cap tt raw-bit H below DR-0004's 0.5 floor; adjacent rings approach 1:1
- **#230**: CI: guard that every test_*.py is wired into a CI workflow and path filter
- **#371**: Regenerate composite layout cells, trng_digital/trng_whole and pex libraries under klayout-tools 0.8.0
- **#381**: verify-whole: adapt the whole-block harness to klayout-tools 0.8.0 VNB handling

## PRs Awaiting Review

PRs waiting on Judge (`loom:review-requested`).

_None._

## Approved (Awaiting Merge)

PRs that passed review and are queued for Champion auto-merge (`loom:pr`).

- **#388**: fix(verify): strip klt 0.8.0 VNB from abstracted stubs, regenerate whole-block evidence

## Proposed

Issues carrying `loom:curated`.

- **#5**: Champion: Merge-Risk Hold Digest *(curated)*
- **#174**: Whole-block characterization: post-layout PVT, dynamic power and IR evidence *(curated)*
- **#221**: Decision record request: local mismatch can cap tt raw-bit H below DR-0004's 0.5 floor; adjacent rings approach 1:1 *(curated)*
- **#230**: CI: guard that every test_*.py is wired into a CI workflow and path filter *(curated)*
- **#262**: Operator decision request: end-of-life Vth-drift sensitivity vs DR-0003 Q margin and DR-0004 health cutoffs (from #254) *(curated)*
- **#289**: Extend seeded transistor raw-bit model cross-checks beyond nominal PVT *(curated)*
- **#307**: Whole-block 12-point PVT matrix: run on the klt batch fleet once the runner image matches the client (follow-up of #174) *(curated)*
- **#314**: Re-pin open_pdks to f6eeac7 (ciel) — fleet retires volare c6d73a3 *(curated)*
- **#347**: Adopt the common artifact store for sim evidence (manifests in git, bytes via klt artifact) *(curated)*
- **#371**: Regenerate composite layout cells, trng_digital/trng_whole and pex libraries under klayout-tools 0.8.0 *(curated)*
- **#381**: verify-whole: adapt the whole-block harness to klayout-tools 0.8.0 VNB handling *(curated)*
- **#395**: Measure the whole-block klt extract on current klt with --progress (on Spot) and report to klayout-tools#4594 *(curated)*

## Proposed (Architect / Hermit)

- **#201**: Gated-off analog block idle/leakage across the full PVT envelope incl. +125 C, with combined digital standby estimate *(architect)*
- **#326**: Consolidate ~18 duplicated sha256 file-hash helpers into one shared helper *(hermit)*
- **#392**: Consolidate hand-rolled corner-bundle record minting in four sim reducers into evidence_record *(hermit)*

## Epics

- **#3**: Track the gap to T1 sim-validated / bronze (klayout-tools design-evidence tiers)
- **#170**: Whole-block integration: compose analog+digital GDS, block DRC/LVS and post-layout PVT (remaining #18 AC3)
