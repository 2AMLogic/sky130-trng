"""Compose one layout cell from klt primitive generators and verify it.

Reads a cell descriptor (``layout/<cell>/cell.json``) and drives the whole
klayout-tools (``klt``) layout chain for that cell, end to end:

    klt gen (per device/tap block)
      -> klt gen-compose (place + route)
      -> klt drc          (rule sign-off)
      -> klt extract      (layout-derived netlist)
      -> klt lvs          (extracted vs. design/*.spice reference)

Every step's JSON response is written next to the descriptor, so the
committed contents of ``layout/<cell>/`` are the full, re-checkable evidence
trail for that cell rather than a bare GDS.

Usage
-----

    python3 layout/bin/compose-cell.py layout/ro_buf/cell.json
    python3 layout/bin/compose-cell.py layout/ro_buf/cell.json --check

``--check`` re-runs everything into a temporary directory and diffs the
verdict-bearing fields against what is committed, without touching the
committed files -- the layout sibling of ``design/netlist.py --check``.

Descriptor shape
----------------

See ``layout/README.md`` and ``layout/ro_buf/cell.json``. In brief::

    {
      "cell": "ro_buf",
      "pdk": {"variant": "sky130A", "deck": "sky130"},
      "blocks": [
        {"id": "mn", "generator": "mos_array", "cell_name": "nfet_...",
         "params": {...}, "orientation": "none"}
      ],
      "placement": {"strategy": "explicit", "order": [...],
                    "origins_um": {...}},
      "routing": {"layer_role": "metal", "width_um": 0.17},
      "connectivity": [...],
      "pins": [...],
      "lvs": {"reference": "design/ro_array_core.spice", "subckt": "ro_buf"}
    }

Two-pass composition (``"stages"``, #27 step 2)
------------------------------------------------

Some gates have two nets that would short if both were routed on the same
metal layer in one ``klt gen-compose`` call -- ``ro_stage``/``ro_nand2``'s
always-on starve devices cross-couple their gates to the *opposite* rail
(``Mph.g = vss``, ``Mnt.g = vddr``), so wiring both crossing nets on the
base ``"metal"`` role in a single pass is not routable without one net
running through the other's block or backbone (see ``layout/README.md``'s
"Composing a gate" section). A cell.json may replace its top-level
``blocks``/``placement``/``routing``/``connectivity``/``pins`` fields with a
``"stages"`` list instead, each entry shaped like those same fields plus a
``"name"`` (required on every stage but the last, which is always named
after the cell itself and always ends up as ``compose.request.json``/
``compose.response.json`` with no prefix -- so ``--check`` and the DRC/
extract/LVS steps below are completely unaware whether a cell used one
stage or several). A later stage's ``blocks[]`` entry may reference an
earlier stage's own composed cell instead of a fresh ``klt gen`` call via
``{"id": ..., "from_stage": "<earlier stage's name>"}``, which resolves to
that stage's own ``<name>.compose.response.json`` -- a valid
``generator_report`` in its own right, since ``klt gen-compose``'s response
already carries ``generator: "gen-compose"`` plus a composed-frame
``ports[]`` promoted from that stage's own ``pins[]`` (this is what the CLI
itself calls composition "nesting"). The usual second stage routes the two
gate-crossing nets on ``"metal2"`` (sky130 met1) with an automatic via-drop
back to each pin's own base-``"metal"``-role pad, over the first stage's
already-composed cell -- see ``layout/ro_stage/cell.json`` for a worked
example and ``layout/ro_stage/README.md`` for why each net landed on the
layer it did.

Placing an already-composed sibling cell (``blocks[].cell``, #27 step 3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A stage's ``blocks[]`` entry may name an *existing* committed stream instead
of a generator or an earlier stage::

    {"id": "g", "cell": {"gds_path": "../ro_nand2/ro_nand2.gds",
                         "cell_name": "ro_nand2", "ports": [...]}}

``gds_path`` is relative to **the cell.json**, not to the output directory,
so it keeps the repo-relative spelling that keeps absolute home paths out of
the committed provenance. ``--check`` rebuilds into a temporary directory
where that relative path resolves to nothing, so there -- and only there --
this script substitutes the resolved absolute path.

Because a pre-existing stream never reported a ``ports[]`` list to any ``klt
gen`` response, its ports are hand-declared. Two things that costs, both
learned building ``layout/ro_ring5/``: the *only* authoritative source for a
two-stage cell's port geometry is its own **intermediate** stage response
(the final one reports ``"ports": []``), and a port may legitimately be
declared on a layer other than li1 -- declaring a rail port on met1, where
the leaf gate's own second stage already drew it, is what lets a later stage
route that rail on ``"metal3"`` within ``gen-compose``'s single-hop via-drop
rule.

Re-placing an earlier stage with hand-declared ports (``cell.from_stage``)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

``blocks[].from_stage`` (above) hands a later stage the earlier stage's own
``gen-compose`` *response*, whose ``ports[]`` are exactly that stage's own
``pins[]`` -- everything a leaf/ring cell's own promotion stages need. An
**array**-level stage needs the other half: to tap an already-composed
stage's own interior conductor at a measured coordinate that was never a
``pins[]`` entry (``ro_array_core``'s ``vdd``/``vss`` promotion stubs start
on each buffer's/XOR's own tap pad *inside* the composed block, and end on a
met1 tip that only exists once that stage has drawn it). That is
``blocks[].cell``'s hand-declared ``ports[]`` shape, pointed at a stage
rather than at a committed sibling cell::

    {"id": "core", "cell": {"from_stage": "vddstub", "ports": [...]}}

``cell_name`` defaults to the stage's own name (which is what
``compose_stage`` names its composed cell) and ``gds_path`` is filled in as
``<stage>.gds``, resolved against the **output** directory. That distinction
is the whole point: a committed sibling cell's ``gds_path`` is relative to
the cell.json and gets rewritten to an absolute path under ``--check``,
whereas a stage's stream is produced by the run in progress and must be read
back from wherever that run is writing -- otherwise a ``--check`` rebuild
would compose its later stages over the *committed* earlier stages and
report "matches" no matter what drifted.

The reference-netlist unit rewrite
----------------------------------

``design/*.spice`` is xschem's own export and is simulated under
``.option scale=1u`` (see any ``sim/*/testbench/*.spice``), so its device
cards carry *unitless* geometry that means micrometres: ``L=0.15 W=0.84``
is a 0.15 um x 0.84 um device.

``klt lvs``'s ``reference.form: "subckt-call"`` converter reads an unsuffixed
value as SI **metres** and rescales it, turning ``L=0.15`` into
``L=150000U`` -- a 0.15 m gate. The compare then fails with a
``device.unmatched``/``net.unmatched`` avalanche and no diagnostic pointing
at the units. Reported upstream (generically) as
2AMLogic/klayout-tools#1492.

Until that is fixed this script appends an explicit ``u`` suffix to the
``L=``/``W=`` values of the extracted reference subckt (and to the values of
any parameter substituted into them), which the converter then reads
correctly. Only the unit spelling changes -- no topology, no net names, no
device count, and the rewritten reference is written to disk
(``<cell>.ref.spice``) so a reviewer can diff it against the source subckt.

A multi-subckt reference (``lvs.dependencies``) needs two more knobs, both
first exercised by ``layout/ro_ring5/``:

``lvs.reference_top``
    Names the reference's top circuit. A file holding three ``.subckt``
    definitions has three *top* circuits as far as the SPICE reader is
    concerned, and ``klt lvs`` errors out rather than guessing which one to
    compare (``reference netlist has 3 top circuits (...); pass 'top' to
    select one``).
``lvs.flatten_reference``
    ``klt extract`` hands LVS a **flat** layout netlist, so a hierarchical
    reference has to be flattened to compare against it. LVS reports this
    back as a ``topology.flattened`` warning on an otherwise-matching run:
    the resulting ``match`` verifies device-for-device and net-for-net
    correspondence, but NOT that the layout's cell hierarchy mirrors the
    schematic's.
``lvs.drop_kwargs``
    Pass-through keyword arguments to strip from instance-call lines that
    are not in ``lvs.params`` -- see ``build_reference``'s transformation 2.

A same-subckt, differently-parametrized reference (``lvs.dependency_variants``,
#22/#27)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``lvs.dependencies`` (above) rewrites each dependency subckt **once**, with
one shared ``lvs.params`` dict -- exactly right when the top subckt
instantiates each dependency a single time (``ro_ring5`` calling
``ro_nand2``/``ro_stage`` once each). It cannot express ``ro_array_core``:
the design netlist defines a **single** ``.subckt ro_ring5 ... wstv=0.42
lstv=2 cld=0.5f`` and calls it four times (``xr1``-``xr4``) with four
different ``wstv=`` overrides, and ``layout/`` holds four physically
distinct ring cells for those four sizings -- one shared ``params`` dict
cannot produce four distinct comparison subckts from one definition.

``lvs.dependency_variants`` is a list of::

    {
      "subckt": "ro_ring5",
      "nested": ["ro_nand2", "ro_stage"],
      "drop_prefixes": ["Cld"],
      "drop_kwargs": ["cld"],
      "instances": [
        {"rename": "_r1", "top_instance_pattern": "^xr1\\b",
         "params": {"wstv": 0.42, "lstv": 2}},
        {"rename": "_r2", "top_instance_pattern": "^xr2\\b",
         "params": {"wstv": 0.44, "lstv": 2}},
        ...
      ]
    }

For each ``instances[]`` entry, ``build_variant_reference`` rewrites
``subckt`` **and every name in ``nested``** (a dependency's own dependencies,
since ``ro_ring5``'s body itself calls ``ro_nand2``/``ro_stage`` -- both need
the *same* per-ring rename so the renamed copies keep calling each other,
not the shared unrenamed originals) using that instance's own ``params``/
``drop_prefixes``/``drop_kwargs`` (falling back to the variant's own, then to
``lvs.drop_prefixes``/``lvs.drop_kwargs``), then suffixes every whole-word
occurrence of ``subckt`` or a ``nested`` name in the rewritten lines with
that instance's own ``rename`` -- so the four sizings coexist as four
distinct subckt definitions in one reference file (``ro_ring5_r1``,
``ro_nand2_r1``, ``ro_stage_r1``, ``ro_ring5_r2``, ...). The rename is
**only** a reference-file bookkeeping device (``lvs.flatten_reference: true``
needs four distinct definitions to inline) -- nothing in ``design/`` or the
composed layout is renamed.

``repoint_variant_instances`` then rewrites the **top** subckt's own
instance-call lines: for each ``dependency_variants[]`` entry's each
``instances[]`` entry, any line matching that instance's own
``top_instance_pattern`` regex has its bare ``subckt`` name suffixed with
``rename`` and every one of that instance's ``params`` keys stripped as a
``key=<value>`` keyword argument (whatever the value -- the top subckt's own
instance-call lines pass **literal** overrides, e.g. ``xr1 ... ro_ring5
wstv=0.42 lstv=2 cld=0.5f``, not the ``name=name`` pass-through form
``build_reference``'s ``drop_kwargs`` handles, so this is a distinct
transformation from that one) since the renamed callee's own header no
longer declares any of those parameters (transformation 1 already
substituted them into literals).

    Four transformations, each deliberately minimal and each visible in the
    written-out result:

    1. ``params`` values are substituted for the subckt's own parameter names
       wherever they appear as an ``=<name>`` value token (this design's
       starve devices are sized ``L=lstv W=wstv``, so this covers ``L=``/
       ``W=`` in particular, but is not limited to them), and the parameter
       defaults are dropped from the ``.subckt`` line. A bare occurrence of
       the parameter name *inside* a quoted expression (e.g. the ``wstv`` in
       ``ad='int((1 + 1)/2) * wstv / 1 * 0.29'``, not immediately preceded by
       ``=``) is deliberately left unevaluated, unchanged from this script's
       original single-subckt behaviour -- see "The LVS match is
       width-sensitive" in ``layout/README.md`` for why that is fine (``klt
       lvs`` does not compare ``ad``/``as``/``pd``/``ps`` for these devices).
    2. A pass-through keyword argument on an instance-call line (``name=name``
       -- e.g. ``xg ro en n1 vddr vss ro_nand2 wstv=wstv lstv=lstv cld=cld``,
       ``ro_ring5``'s own forwarding of its parameters to each sub-gate
       instance) is dropped entirely rather than substituted, once a
       multi-subckt reference (``lvs.dependencies``, below) needs to
       instantiate one already-parameterized subckt from another: the callee
       subckt's own header no longer declares that parameter (transformation
       1 already stripped it, replacing every internal use with a literal),
       so passing it by keyword would name an undeclared parameter.
       ``drop_kwargs`` extends this to a pass-through parameter that is *not*
       in ``params`` because nothing surviving the rewrite reads it -- e.g.
       ``cld``, whose only use is the ``Cld`` load capacitor transformation 3
       removes. Left in place, ``klt lvs``'s SPICE reader warns
       ``Not a known parameter for circuit 'RO_STAGE': 'CLD'`` once per
       instance line and silently ignores it, so dropping it is cosmetic
       for the verdict but keeps the generated reference free of warnings a
       reviewer would otherwise have to triage.
    3. Element cards whose name starts with one of ``drop_prefixes`` are
       removed -- for this design that is ``ro_stage``/``ro_nand2``'s ``Cld``
       lumped load capacitor, a *simulation* load model with no physical
       counterpart in the layout, not a device the layout omits.
    4. Unitless ``L=``/``W=`` values gain an explicit ``u`` suffix -- see this
       module's docstring for why (klayout-tools#1492).

    A committed sibling cell (``gds_path``)
        A previously-composed, already-committed

        request shape (``{gds_path, cell_name, ports[], bbox_um}``, #1189 in
        klayout-tools). No ``klt gen`` call: there is nothing to generate,
        only an existing stream to place. See
        ``layout/ro_ring5-connectivity-poc/README.md`` for why this needs
        hand-declared ``ports[]`` (a pre-existing cell never reported a
        ``ports[]`` list to any ``klt gen`` response the way a fresh
        primitive does). Its ``gds_path`` is written relative to the
        **cell.json** (e.g. ``"../ro_nand2/ro_nand2.gds"``), which keeps the
        repo-relative spelling that keeps absolute home paths out of the
        committed provenance. Rebuilding in place (``out_dir`` is the cell's
        own directory) that resolves correctly as written; ``--check``
        rebuilds into a temporary directory instead, where it resolves to
        nothing -- so there, and only there, the resolved absolute path of
        the sibling cell's committed stream is substituted.

    An earlier stage of this same cell.json (``from_stage``)
        See this module's docstring, "Re-placing an earlier stage with
        hand-declared ports". That stream is written into ``out_dir`` by
        **this** run, so its path is relative to the *output* directory and
        must NOT be absolutized against ``spec_dir``: doing so would point a
